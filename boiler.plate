        Vets who code! Louis Rodriguez Introduction
    </title> 

    <p>
        Louis Rodriguez, Army Reserve, 386th Med Log, 68J Medical Logistician</h6>
        I was drawn into tech after leaving the military.
        I started working as truck driver and listening to
        plenty of podcast and talk radio while on the road.
        I found out about AWS funding programs at community colleges.
        After knocking out some math courses I started to dive into networking, cloud utlities, and
        now I have peaked an interest in programming.
